Created password generator. 

Created a function to prompt user for parameters to create random password. Stored parameters in a master array. Created a for loop to run through character choices, including code to validate at least one character of each type of character that was requested. Then code pulled random characters for the rest of the password. Stored password in new variable and displayed final password on screen.
